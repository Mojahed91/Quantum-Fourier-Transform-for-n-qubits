# Characterizing Coherent Errors in Quantum Fourier Transform 

The main goal of this project is to show by simulation how our protocol quantifies the amount of coherent errors in a quantum circuit.  The contained tutorials were created as a continuation of my master's research to publish as an article.

# The Motivation Examples 
Within tutorials/QFT.py, I have written up motivating example using  QFT (Quantum Fourier Transform). A coherent error (controlable and uncontrolable coherent errors look at Ref[1]) have been added to each CNOT in addtion to the effect of ADC (amplitude damping channel) to each crosse resonance.

## The extraction of coherent errors assosiated with CNOT gate in 4-qubit QFT 

* Simulate the 4-qubit QFT under the above asumptions

  Within this simulation a transformation from Helbert space to Liouville space took place. For further explination look at Ref[1]

* Apply Randomiesed Compiling (RC) to each CNOT
  
  The implentation that prevent the cancelation of conrollable coherent errors.

* Applying RC to $QFT$ and it's inverse $QFT^{-1}$

  The purpose of this step is to implemnt the KIK method et al. [1,2]. Deonted $QFT^{-1}$ by K and $QFT^{-1}$ by KI, therfore the controlable coherent errors are cancelled and we reman with the uncontrollabel coherent errors.

## Here are the main results.

* The variation in the error rate p with fixing the coherent error (Controlled and Uncontrolled)

* Fixing the incoherent error (ADC) and varying the coherent errors (Controlled and Uncontrolled), I mentor the change in the incoherent Pauli and Native error
