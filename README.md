# Characterizing Coherent Errors in Quantum Fourier Transform 

The main goal of this project is to show by simulation how our protocol for quantifying the amount of coherent errors is applicable in a quantum circuit.

# The Motivation Examples 
We provide an example using  QFT (Quantum Fourier Transform). A coherent error (controlable and uncontrolable coherent errors) have been added to each CNOT in addtion to the effect of ADC (amplitude damping channel) to each the crosse resonance.
